A hypothesized solution so far is to add the deleted flag to your patch plugin on these references so that the creation kit does not recognize them 
when generating previsibines and once the generations are complete, to undelete the references (xedit's QAC). Idk how the visibility will look in 
game. You could also not use the Enhanced Settlements Addon as it is an addon or wait for Horizon v1.9 when it comes out.
