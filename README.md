A small preface before I begin, I've never been that good at documenting in a clear and consice manner, so bear with me as I make some explanation here. This living manual is not going to be very pretty at this stage as my current goal is to explain the methods used as best I can to those that don't know that much on how to use the Creation Kit, like me.

To start, what are precombines exactly? Well, depending on who you ask, trouble, a pain in the butt, a collection of smashed together meshes in the game, and quite possibly a menace to the modding community in some respects.

So, to start out, there's a few things that need to happen to get your game to be able to deal with this effectively. At the bare minimum, you need the following:

A copy of the Creation Kit, version 1.10.162 as of this manual's current commit.
The latest XEdit / FO4Edit release, version 4.0.4 as of this commit.
A copy of Pra's xedit scripts.
A decent amount of hard drive space, and more importantly, physical ram, depending on the size of the project and how it's created.
