The known list of PRP patches are here. Send pull requests if you have them and are not on the list. I don't intend to keep very good track of branch versions for patches outside of my own. Users should check the mod pages accordingly and install the correct patch versions that match the PRP branch they are using. Also, I am terrible at Markdown, apparently.

Last updated: 04 09 2023

Current available branches: 59, 65, 69 (**65 is the current recommended build**)

Please note that unless a patch has been made against a patch, assume any external patch is not compatible with any others due to the way precombines are constructed. You can't just slap five compatibility patches together and make it work magically.

External patches with PRP as a dependency:
- [Desperados Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/45169) Since 0.3.0 (PRP patch 0.3.1 for branch 65, 0.3.2 for branch 69, original release 0.2.0 is the Shadowofthewind generation and still works, but is unsupported)

External mods that PRP depends on:
- [Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4598) (59 was built with 2.1.3, 65 with 2.1.4, 69 with 2.1.5; 59 will likely crash with 2.1.5 installed due to record changes since it was built, avoid using unless you haven't updated)
